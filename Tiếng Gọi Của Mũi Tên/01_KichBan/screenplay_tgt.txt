EXT. CLIFFSIDE - MORNING

A prehistoric tribe, gaunt-faced, gathers below a cliff. Fog blankets the valley. KAI (30s, large, old scars), the tribal leader, stands on a rocky outcrop, his sharp gaze sweeping the landscape. He lets out a low growl. Worry is etched on everyone's faces.

EXT. FOREST - MORNING

LYRA (20s, agile, stealthy), a young hunter, hides behind bushes. She carefully bends a flexible branch, ties animal sinew, forming a crude bow. She nocks a stone arrow, draws, and shoots. The arrow pierces a small tree trunk. Lyra smirks, satisfied.

INT. CAVE - DAY

ELARA (10s, bright-eyed, curious), a young girl, sits before a cave wall. She uses a piece of charcoal to draw images of people holding spears hunting a mammoth. Her eyes sparkle with intense focus.

EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

KAI and a group of male hunters, armed with long spears, attempt to corner a large, shaggy beast. The aggressive animal gores one hunter. The spears are too short, too slow. Kai roars in frustration as the beast escapes.

EXT. DEEP FOREST - AFTERNOON

Lyra hides high in a tree, observing a herd of grazing animals far in the distance. Stone spears are useless at this range. She looks down at the bow in her hand, a spark igniting in her eyes.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lyra is diligently sharpening new arrows by the fire. Kai appears, casting a long shadow. He sees the bow and arrows. Kai snatches the bow from Lyra's hands, throwing it to the ground. He growls, pointing to his stone spear, signaling Lyra to use the old tools. Lyra bows her head.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - MORNING

The tribe moves slowly across a barren, rocky mountainside. An air of desperation. Kai leads, his gaze searching in vain. Children whimper from hunger.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

A massive SABER-TOOTH TIGER suddenly emerges from a cliff face, roaring menacingly. The tribe panics, cornered against the cliff wall. Kai bravely stands guard, brandishing his spear. The tiger bares its fangs, lunging forward.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

In the chaos, Lyra swiftly retrieves her bow and arrow. Her eyes quickly scan the situation, focusing on the tiger.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

Lyra, with incredible speed and precision, draws her bow and shoots. The arrow lodges in the tiger's shoulder. The beast roars in pain, stumbles, and turns, fleeing into the shadows.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

Kai turns back, looking at Lyra. His gaze shifts from anger, to surprise, then gradually to admiration. The tribe sighs in relief, some beginning to look at Lyra differently.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Kai sits by the fire, setting his crude stone spear down. He picks up Lyra's bow, carefully examining it. He looks at Lyra, nodding slowly. Lyra smiles, a radiant smile. Elara is drawing on the cave wall: a woman holding a bow and arrow, standing beside a man holding a spear.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT (4s)

CLOSE UP on the new drawing: the woman with the bow and arrow and the man with the spear stand side-by-side, looking forward, symbolizing the fusion of tradition and innovation. The flickering firelight illuminates the drawing, like an eternal message.
